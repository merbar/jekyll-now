title: Autonomous Driving / ADAS Projects Overview
---
I am a Software Developer, Technical Animator and Machine Learning enthusiast with more than 10 years of experience in the visual effects industry - simulating natural phenomena, setting up data pipelines and improving workflows.

Depending on production schedule and needs, I have scripted quick prototypes of tools, automated I/O data handling between applications, and wrote fully featured C++ plugins to bridge gaps in the pipeline and increase my team's productivity across multiple software packages in all major operating systems.

In dealing with traffic in Los Angeles and all it's dangers and inefficiencies, I developed a passion for Autonomous Driving. The fire was fueled by diving deep into relevant skills via the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree at Sebastian Thrun's platform, Udacity. I continue being driven by finding creative solutions to technical challenges that can make an immediate and lasting impact on peoples' lives.

This blog serves as a hub for my ADAS / Autonomous Driving-related software projects.  

Thank you for your interest!
