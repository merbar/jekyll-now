Before I embarked on my career change into Autonomous Driving, I worked for 10 years in the Visual Effects Industry for several companies. I was part of small, agile teams on tight deadlines as well as large corporations with over a thousand employees. I simulated natural phenomena (cloth, hair, fur), wrote python tools and UIs as well as C++ plugins for third party applications mainly dealing with deformation of 3-dimensional geometry.

As is customary in the VFX industry, one has a demo reel that shows off ones best work. Here is one of my latest ones... for your consideration ;)
